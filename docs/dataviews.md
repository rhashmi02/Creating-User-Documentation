How to Generate data views
To analyze your data and generate a data view, you must set the query filters, and then run the query. After you generate the data view, you can work with your results.

            Customized data views present your data based on the queries you create to analyze the tasks, clusters, and targets associated with your project.
            The maximum number of results you can receive in  is 10,000. By default, the maximum number of results is 2,000. This value can be changed in the Settings menu within your Account page.
        To generate a data view:Open an existing data analysis task in the Entity Pane, or create a new data analysis task in the Query Pane.In the Query Pane, use the query filters to further develop or modify your analysis. Some of the filters have a Select All button. This button does not appear if there are more than 100 entities to select from, because if you query too many entities the report takes too long to generate.
                Set a date and time range for the report.Click Generate button.
                    If there are invalid filters, the Generate button is unavailable.
                The query results are displayed in the Analysis Pane. You can sort the results by column.Analyze the query results.
                    The query results depend on the type of data analysis task.
                Work with the query results.
                    Depending on the items in the query results, you can print, export, or save your data analysis as a data view.
                (Optional) Save the data view as a template.
                    This will save your current query filter and report column settings.
